BUILDING
********

This is the SIPp package. Please refer to the http://sipp.sourceforge.net/
webpage for details and download of the last version.

Normally, you should be able to build SIPp by just typing
"autoreconf -ivf; ./configure --with-pcap --with-sctp; make" in the
current directory. Then "sipp -h" will give you access to the online help.

CONTRIBUTING
************

SIPp is free software, under the terms of the GPL licence (see the
LICENCE.txt file for details). You can contribute to the development
of SIPp and contact us via Sourceforge to integrate your changes. If you
make changes in Sipp, *PLEASE* follow a few coding rules:

  - Use 80 columns code,

  - Do *NOT* use tabulations for indentation. Use spaces,

  - Please stay conform with the current indentation style (2 spaces
    indent, standard Emacs-like indentation). Examples:

    if (condition) {
      f();
    } else {
      g();
    }

  - Use "{" in if conditions even if there is only one instruction
    (see example above).

  - Do not use std C++ libs if something equivalent exists in libc
    (better portability). (e.g. prefer "printf" to "cout <<" ).

  - Check your changes can be compiled on:

      - Linux,
      - HPUX,
      - Tru64,

    (We can provide help on these portability points).
